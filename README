This is the huffman coding : 
	Huffman coding uses a specific method for choosing the representation for each symbol, resulting in a prefix code that expresses 
	the most common source symbols using shorter strings of bits than are used for less common source symbols.

This was my first project in my first year of engineering school.
	The langage was imposed : java
	We must write our own structures : the tree and the list
	We must have an IHM

Moreover I used only french for this project.

In order to use the program :
	javac Ihm.java
	java Ihm
	Put the file name to compress in the text box without any extension.
