# Huffman coding

Huffman coding uses a specific method for choosing the representation for each symbol, resulting in a prefix code that expresses the most common source symbols using shorter strings of bits than are used for less common source symbols.

## First project, rules from school

This was my first project in my first year of engineering school (2010).

1. The language was imposed : java
2. We must write our own structures : the tree and the list
3. We must have an IHM

Moreover I used only French for this project.

## Use

    javac Ihm.java    
    java Ihm

Put the file name to compress in the text box without any extension.

## Notes

When I realized this project I don't know git and github. 
Therefore I have just one big commit for all the source code.
